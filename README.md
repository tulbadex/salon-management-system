#### Description:

## Overview
The Salon Management System is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline operations for hair salons and beauty parlors. Built with Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Bootstrap, this system provides a complete solution for managing customers, appointments, services, staff, and financial records. The application features a responsive interface that works across all devices, ensuring accessibility for both salon staff and clients.

## Features

#### Public-Facing Features
- **Landing Page**: Attractive homepage showcasing salon services
- **Service Catalog**: Interactive display of hairstyles with images
- **About Section**: Salon information and service guarantees
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first adaptive layouts

#### Staff Features (Authentication Required)
- **Customer Management**: Full CRUD operations with profile tracking
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Calendar interface with conflict detection
- **Service Management**: Hairstyle catalog with image uploads
- **Financial Tracking**: Expense recording and revenue reports
- **User Management**: Role-based access control (Admin/Staff)

## Technical Implementation

### Backend
- **Framework**: Flask 3.1 with blueprints
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login with session management and password hashing (bcrypt)
- **File Handling**: Secure image uploads with validation (file type, size) to dedicated uploads directory
- **Security**: CSRF protection, secure headers, and input sanitization

### Frontend
- **Templating**: Jinja2 with template inheritance and macros
- **Styling**: Bootstrap 5 with custom CSS variables for theming
- **Icons**: Bootstrap Icons v1.8+ for consistent iconography
- **Interactive Elements**: jQuery for AJAX functionality and DOM manipulation
- **Forms**: Client-side validation with server-side fallback

### Database Schema
The system uses a relational database with these main tables:
- **Users**: id, username, password_hash, role, last_login
- **Customers**: id, name, phone, email, gender, image_path, registration_date
- **Hairstyles**: id, name, description, price, image_path
- **Appointments**: id, customer_id, hairstyle_id, appointment_date, completed, amount_paid
- **Expenses**: id, item, amount, description, expense_date, category

## Design Decisions

1. **Dual Interface Approach**:
   - Public pages use lighter design with focus on services
   - Admin interface has dense information layout with quick actions
   - Clear visual distinction between modes using color coding

2. **Image Handling**:
   - Secure upload process with filename sanitization
   - Automatic thumbnail generation for consistency
   - Default SVG illustrations for missing images
   - Regular cleanup of orphaned files

3. **Authentication System**:
   - Session-based authentication with secure cookies
   - Password complexity requirements
   - Automatic logout after inactivity
   - Failed login attempt throttling

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Bootstrap grid system with custom breakpoints
   - Adaptive tables for small screens
   - Touch-friendly interface elements
   - Reduced motion options for accessibility
