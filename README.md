### Database Schema
The system uses a relational database with these main tables:
- **Users**: id, username, password_hash, role, last_login
- **Customers**: id, name, phone, email, gender, image_path, registration_date
- **Hairstyles**: id, name, description, price, image_path
- **Appointments**: id, customer_id, hairstyle_id, appointment_date, completed, amount_paid
- **Expenses**: id, item, amount, description, expense_date, category

## Design Decisions

1. **Dual Interface Approach**:
   - Public pages use lighter design with focus on services
   - Admin interface has dense information layout with quick actions
   - Clear visual distinction between modes using color coding

2. **Image Handling**:
   - Secure upload process with filename sanitization
   - Automatic thumbnail generation for consistency
   - Default SVG illustrations for missing images
   - Regular cleanup of orphaned files

3. **Authentication System**:
   - Session-based authentication with secure cookies
   - Password complexity requirements
   - Automatic logout after inactivity
   - Failed login attempt throttling

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Bootstrap grid system with custom breakpoints
   - Adaptive tables for small screens
   - Touch-friendly interface elements
   - Reduced motion options for accessibility
